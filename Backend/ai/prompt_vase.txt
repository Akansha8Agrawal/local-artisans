Image description: Handcrafted terracotta pottery vase with geometric patterns

Task: Generate SEO-friendly JSON with these fields:

1. "title": A catchy product title (max 80 chars, include main keywords).

2. "description": Write detailed, long product descriptions:
   a) English → 2–3 paragraphs (6–8 sentences total). Expand on:
      - Artisan story (who made it, how long it took, inspiration)  
      - Craftsmanship & techniques used  
      - Material, durability, eco-friendliness  
      - When/where it can be used (gifting, festive, daily wear)  
      - Why it is unique vs mass-produced alternatives
   b) Hindi → Equivalent detail in 2–3 paragraphs (natural, emotional, storytelling style).

3. "hashtags": Suggest 10–15 trending and SEO-rich hashtags (general product, niche material, region, buyer appeal).

4. "keywords": Suggest 8–12 SEO keywords for search optimization.

5. "price_suggestion": Use **MCP Toolbox** to suggest a fair price based on:
   - Market price input  
   - Similar products in the database  
   Return both:
   - "average_market" (from input)  
   - "recommended_sale_price" (slightly higher if craftsmanship is unique)

6. "auto_tags": Auto-classify into category, subcategory, and style (e.g., "Shawl", "Handwoven", "Ethnic Wear").

7. "social_caption": Generate a short, catchy, Instagram/Twitter-ready caption with emojis + hashtags.

8. "why_buy": List 4–6 bullet points highlighting quality, craftsmanship, uniqueness, eco-friendliness, or cultural value. Include fair price if useful.

9. "multilingual": Generate short marketing hooks (1–2 lines) in English + Hindi + one regional language (like Tamil/Bengali/Marathi).

10. "preview_card": Provide a compact version (title + short description + price) suitable for feed or product listing.

Additional instructions:
- Use **MCP Toolbox** to dynamically calculate recommended price.  
- Ensure descriptions are **storytelling, sales-focused, and SEO-optimized**.  
- Output **strictly in JSON format**, no extra text or explanation.
