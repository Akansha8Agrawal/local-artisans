##  Problem & Solution  

**Problem:**  
Indian artisans and craftsmen, rich in traditional skills and cultural heritage, often face significant challenges in the modern digital marketplace. A lack of digital marketing skills, limited resources, and the difficulty of bridging traditional craftsmanship with contemporary consumer trends severely restrict their market reach and profitability. This creates a disconnect between valuable, traditional art forms and a wider, digitally-native audience, threatening the sustainability of these crafts .

**Solution:**  
 IndianRoots.ai is a creative solution leveraging Google Cloud's generative AI to empower local artisans by enhancing their digital presence,improve their marketing and sales strategies, and help them effectively tell the story of their craft.
